PHPoole is an easy and lightweight static website generator, written in PHP.

PHPoole takes your content (written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) plain text format) and merges files with layouts ([Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates) to generate static HTML files.

PHPoole is a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) application, powered by the [PHPoole core library](https://github.com/PHPoole/PHPoole-library).
