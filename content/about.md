# About

PHPoole is a CLI application powered by [PHP](http://www.php.net), that takes [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents and merge them with [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates to generated a static web site.

The [first version](https://github.com/PHPoole/PHPoole/commit/6ab57ae168555237251807ec5882ea3d2041a291) was created in Sep 2013 and was just an all in one PHP script powered by Zend\Console.

Since the 2.x version PHPoole use a powerful [core library](https://github.com/PHPoole/PHPoole-library), decoupled from the CLI application.
