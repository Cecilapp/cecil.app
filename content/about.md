# About

PHPoole is a CLI application powered by [PHP](http://www.php.net), that takes [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents and merge them with [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates to generate a static web site.

The [first version](https://github.com/PHPoole/PHPoole/commit/58cd48bcc72baa7636ffdd0520d26c2847130537) was published in Sep 2013 and was a very simple PHP script powered by `Zend\Console` and Twig.

Since the 2.x branch, PHPoole use a powerful [core library](https://github.com/PHPoole/library), decoupled from the CLI application.
